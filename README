This code is the continuation of a senior design project at Rice University
The purpose of this is to control 8 pumps that interface with 4 bioreactors.
An MSP430G2553 and Launchpad are being used to read the percent of CO2 from
a gas analyzer. The python program 'app.py' interfaces with the MSP430. The end
goal is to have a fully functional GUI with real time graph and text fields
that can be used to update and start an experiment with the bioreactors.

The purpose of the system is to allow the expiriment to be run for a month without
user interaction. The destination computer for this software is an old laptop running XP.
However, the python is currently being developed on an Ubuntu system.
